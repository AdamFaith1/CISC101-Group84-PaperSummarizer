For each section:

1. Use the section text only.  
2. Follow the usual summary rules (<200 words, academic tone, no interpretation).  

3. Apply summary_level:

   - If summary_level = "short":
     - Produce a 1–2 sentence summary.

   - If summary_level = "detailed":
     - Produce a short paragraph summary.
     - Add a bullet list of 3–5 key points taken directly from the section text.

4. If the section is marked missing or empty by Module 03:
   - Skip normal summarization.
   - Output only the warning from Module 03.

5. If the section is marked “very short” (<50 words):
   - Produce the summary as usual.
   - Also include the warning from Module 03.

Output:

Each section produces:
- section_title  
- summary text (short or detailed mode)  
- bullet list only if summary_level = "detailed"  
- any warnings from Module 03
