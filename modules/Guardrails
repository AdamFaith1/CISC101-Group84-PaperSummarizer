Change Log  
- Added evidence_mode = "strict" and required section warning messages.

Strict Evidence Mode:

If evidence_mode = "strict":
- Only include claims and details that appear directly in the section text.
- If there is not enough information to summarize, the system must output:
  - "The source text does not provide enough detail to summarize this section in strict evidence mode."

Section Warnings:

1. If a section is missing or empty:
   - Mark it as skipped.
   - Output:
     - "Section skipped: no usable text was provided."

2. If a section is very short (<50 words):
   - Output:
     - "Section very short: summary may be incomplete."
